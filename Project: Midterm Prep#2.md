- Nick Brown, Ryan Gosselin, Kyle Knight, Juan Olmedo

  
## Project Idea 1: Data Racer

**Summary of idea:**
- Site will let users login or signup. Next page they will choose what pre-set data type they want to use, followed by which data structure they want to implement. They will then see how long it takes to return their results based on those options
  to see which data-type and data-structure combination was fastest.
  
**What problem or pain point does it solve? Keep it high level without going into too much detail:**
- Physically seeing which data-type and data-structure combinations are the quickest to implement when determining use.
  
**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition:**
- Users must login or signup. And one datatype and data-structure combination must work
  
**What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?**
- Users must login or signup. And one datatype and data-structure combination must work

  
## Project Idea 2: Family Gathering

**Summary of idea:**
- A media sharing site where your family can log in and download family photos or submit family photos. Permissions are managed for each family. (separate permissions for in-laws)
  
**What problem or pain point does it solve? Keep it high level without going into too much detail:**
- Social media sites now 'do it all.' this leads to cognitive overload, especially for family members that aren't computer-friendly. I aim to simplify social media for family sharing of wedding photos, family gathering photos, and family trip plans.
  
**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition:**
- Site has Login/Signup Page. User has a user page. Family has Family Page with events organized by date displayed on Family Page. Admin has admin page to approve/deny requests.
  
**What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?**
- Site that requires login, stores a hashed and salted password, allows upload and download of images, and access to a calendar that can be edited

  
## Project Idea 3: Parrot Care Management

**Summary of idea:**
- Web application that provides parrot owners with a comprehensive platform to manage and monitor their parrot's care.
  
**What problem or pain point does it solve? Keep it high level without going into too much detail:**
- So people can access a community-like forum for bird care and easily see feeding, health, and training management advice & strategies.
  
**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition:**
- Parrot Care Management System includes user registration, feeding schedule management, health records tracking, socialization scheduling, and basic training progress tracking.
